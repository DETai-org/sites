# Mutual Aid as a Factor of Evolution

For Marx, the human being is primarily a social creature. He needs other people not because they are means for satisfying his desires, but simply because a person is a person, and only then does he possess human completeness when he is connected with others. Goethe asserted: "a person knows himself only as much as he knows the world. He knows the world only within himself and becomes aware of himself only within the world."
Erich Fromm said: "A fully developed and therefore healthy person is a productive person, a person genuinely interested in the world and responsive to its calls" (E. Fromm, *Out of the Chains of Illusions*, pp. 85–88).
