# Multidisciplinary Approach

One of the reasons to combine training, health practices, and psychology.

Follow the principle of holistic development (keep the Gestalt)!!! ⚜️

*"Any explanation that analyzes one area and excludes others will be unbalanced and therefore incorrect" (E. Fromm, "The Sane Society", p. 296).*

Socio-economic, spiritual, psychological, and physical states consider the same phenomenon from different perspectives, and the task is to understand how these various aspects are interconnected and how they interact. *"What is true of the causes is, of course, also true of the means by which the defects of modern man can be remedied" (ibid.).* ✍🏻✍🏻✍🏻

If I believe that the true cause of illness is physiological or psychological, then, of course, I should think that eliminating this cause leads to recovery. On the other hand, if I see how different aspects are interconnected, I come to the conclusion that the spiritual health of society can be achieved only through simultaneous changes in physical culture, labor, spiritual and psychological orientation, in the character structure, and in cultural detail. 👌

*"If we focus our efforts on a single sphere and ignore or exclude the others, this is fraught with destructive consequences for change as a whole. In this lies, apparently, one of the most important obstacles on the path of human progress" (ibid., p. 297).*

In the training process, unity of bodily, intellectual, and psychological components is also ensured for the formation of personality. There is a close interconnection and interdependence in the development of a person's spiritual, emotional-sensory, and physical spheres.

*"One integrated step forward in all spheres of life will have far more far-reaching and long-term results for a person than a hundred steps in one isolated sphere".*
