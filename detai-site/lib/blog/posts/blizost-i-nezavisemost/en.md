# Closeness and Independence

The paradox of human existence is that a person at the same time seeks both closeness and independence, union with others and the preservation of their uniqueness... Productive love implies care for another person, a sense of responsibility for their life — not only in the sense of their physical existence, but also for the growth and development of all their capabilities. Productive love is incompatible with passivity toward life...

Thus, care and responsibility are inseparable qualities of love, but without respect for the one you love, the desire to know them ever more fully and deeply makes love degenerate into domination over a person and possession of them as a thing. 💙
