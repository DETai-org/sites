## Strength and light

This is an eternal conflict, shadows itching to fall into doubts, different demons, super-ideas, at times the urge to lie under granite. Chaos and pain, troubles with yourself. Fears→Freedom→Thanatos→Love... About such a person the everyday man will say: "Hysterical"! — Of course, he’s alive!!!

## Chaos and darkness

You are so pleased with yourself, calm, joyful, ordinary... and what: football, discos, a little beer, a car, TV and sex — a classic mid-level manager type, the life of the party, he keeps spinning an office romance.

"What inner conflict do you have?

How to pick a tie today to match the jacket color?

How to pick sneakers to match the snapback?"

But there will be no clap when two palms don’t meet in it.

And though Day and Night look like enemies. They serve a single goal,

In mutual love they multiply their common labors.

If there were no Night, how could there gather in a person the Wealth that Day spends so generously?
