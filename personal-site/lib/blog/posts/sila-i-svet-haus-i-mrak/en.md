## Power and Light

This is an eternal conflict: shadows fall into doubt, various demons, super-ideas, a desire to lie beneath the granite. Chaos and pain, troubles with the self. Fear → Freedom → Thanatos → Love... The average onlooker says, “Hysterical!” — of course, because he is alive.

## Chaos and Darkness

You’re so satisfied with yourself, calm, joyful, ordinary... and what? Football, discos, a beer, a car, TV, and sex — the classic mid-level manager, the soul of the company, always spinning the office romance.

“What inner conflict do you have?

How to pick a tie to match the jacket today?

How to pick sneakers to match the snapback?”

But there will be no clap if two palms don’t meet within it.

And though Day and Night look like enemies, they serve a single purpose,

In mutual love they multiply their shared labors.

If there were no Night, how could there be in a human the wealth that Day spends so generously?
