# CAN A PERSON CHANGE?

## ⭐ CAN A PERSON CHANGE? ⭐

Every person sooner or later asks whether they are capable of change. Whether it is a change in appearance or inner psychological transformations, is there a limit to human flexibility? Or is everything we see the result of our inner structure and inherited traits that inevitably predetermine behavior and outward appearance?

## ❇️ PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CHANGES ❇️

A person can change their habits, views, and even their appearance. This is supported not only by awareness of the need for change, but also by active work on oneself. On the path of personal transformation there are different stages that can lead to visible changes both in the body and in the mind.

## ❇️ CHANGE THROUGH TENSION AND REFLECTION ❇️

***“The growth or change of a human personality consists in changing the ways of relieving tension.”*** (E. Berne, 1957, p. 97). This thought emphasizes the importance of psycho-emotional work with oneself in order to relieve inner tension that hinders personal growth.

## ❇️ REFLECTION AND ACTION AS A PATH TO DEVELOPMENT ❇️

***“It is necessary to change one’s attitude toward oneself, people, and work from irrational to rational through reflection and action.”*** (M. Litvak, 2015, p. 25). Changes in perception and attitude toward life do not happen by themselves; it is important to actively reflect and take concrete actions.

## ❇️ CONFLICT AS A NECESSARY STAGE OF CHANGE ❇️

***“There would have been no changes in personality if there had been no conflicts beforehand.”*** (K. Horney, 2013, p. 38). Inner and outer conflicts become catalysts for change, prompting a person to seek new paths of development and solutions.

## ❇️ THE INFLUENCE OF THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT ❇️

***“Radical changes in the environment lead to significant changes in human behavior.”*** (E. Fromm, 1976, p. 167). A change in one’s surroundings, whether a workplace or a social circle, often becomes an impetus for changing behavior and worldview.

***“When a person has only just begun their development, their behavior is already guided by instincts only to a very limited extent. Aside from the elementary instincts of self-preservation and sexual drive, a person has no other innate or inherited programs that would prescribe how to behave in most situations involving decision-making.”*** (E. Fromm, 1973, p. 291). This statement reminds us that in the process of development a person is freed from dependence on instinctive programs and gains the ability to consciously change their decisions and behavior. 🔂
